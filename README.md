# INTERACTIVE-MODULE-FOR-DYSLEXIC-CHILDREN
An interactive module is being designed for dyslexic students to improve their auditory and visual skills by the use of interactive multimedia elements. The methodology uses infrared reflective sensors to recognise letters as an input for the words written by the dyslexic students, which are further, processed to make valid combination of useful words. The valid combination of words are accompanied by both image and audio of the corresponding word interpreted thereby improving the visual perception and auditory perception of the child respect.
